Oh, Java, how great you truly are,
A shining beacon, the programming star!
With your syntax so clean and pristine,
Who needs simplicity? You’re so serene.

Your "Hello World" takes 500 lines,
But hey, it’s fine – more code, more signs!
Forget Python’s ease, its charm, its grace,
We love a maze in a dark, cramped space.

Who needs a “null” check? Just dive right in,
Let runtime exceptions be your win.
And memory leaks? Let them run free!
Garbage collection’s a mystery to me.

Oh, how we cherish the endless compile,
A thousand errors, each one a trial.
Forget the speed, the joy, the fun –
It’s all worth it for a language that’s done!

Yes, Java, you’re the one we adore,
Your bloated frameworks, we yearn for more.
For when coding feels like digging in sand,
Java’s there, holding our hand.
